          <h3>Money Lost</h3>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em;">
            When we look at cyber crime, typically our first instinct is to question how the company will recover the missing/damaged information or how they will get their operations up and running again.
            Many people just think it's as simple as just putting in some extra hours to get everything back to normal, when in reality, there is much more to it than that.
            Calculating the cost of cyber crime has many, many factors that come into play, for example the infrastructure of the organizations network that fell victim and what type of attack occurred.
            To start, we need to break down attack statistics into their average costs. Attacks can have multiple major impacts, but the two most common are:
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1; text-indent: 4em; font-weight: bold;">
            1. A disruption in business proceedures
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1; text-indent: 4em; font-weight: bold;">
            2. A loss or damage of information
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
            Now obviously both of these impacts cost differently from attack to attack, but the average cost to get 'back to normal' is $1.2M for proceedure disruption and $1.4M for information loss. On an annually increasing average,
            global costs for cyber crime, as of 2015 is $3T, and is expected to be upwards of $6T in 2021. This loss of time and information can cover grounds like intellectual property theft/loss (such as blueprints, code, patented ideas, etc.), money stolen, stolen credentials, damaged technology, time spent, etc.
            With that being said, what else is there to an attack? What is costing us so much to recover from cyber crime and cyber attacks?
          </p>
          <h3>Why Does It Cost So Much?</h3>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em;">
            When breaking down the costs, we have to look at the company, their security, what information was lost/damaged, what kind of attack took place, and so much more. All of these, and more as stated, add up to the average cost of
            recovery. But, why is it all so expensive? To know exactly why, we need to look at the recovery process and how the victim is going to prevent this in the future. All of the initial processes that the victims take also have many
            dependencies, which are somewhat similar to how they go about deciding cost. With this in mind, we must also know that costs are decided by new security implementation, new hardware/software, and new guidelines. Also, with CMMC,
            and other mandatory guidelines being strictly put into place in many companies/organizations, although not directly linked to cyber crime, this also puts the security cost up due to reconfiguring and checking to make
            sure these guidelines are put into place correctly. So, for example, let pretend we're dealing with a malware/ransomware attack. When dealing with such an attack, commonly thought of as the worst kind, we need to look at what
            occurs with this kind of attack. Malware/ransomware, in short, encrypts (making it so YOU cannot read/access it) everything on a computer/network and demands money in return of getting it unencrypted. In this scenario, everything is affected,
            meaning servers, computers, data, storage hardware, etc. Depending on the magnitude of the malware/randomware, your hardware might be done for. If this were to happen, almost everything that got infected would have to be replaced, and all of
            the data would have to be backed up, if it isn't lost for good (which would be one of the worst scenarios). Dealing with backed up data is a very long process, because you know what you have to do, but you just have to do it over and over again. Also, companies have to look into better security measures, like
            disconnecting certain networks from each other so that if one gets infected, the other doesnt immediately and they could potentially stop the spread beforehand. Buying new hardware for storage or replacing damaged hardware adds a lot of the cost
            immediately, but so does increasing security measures once it's all said and done.
          </p>
          <h3>The Recovery Process</h3>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em;">
            Now finally we can talk about recovery. Taking each attack as a learning experience is all that can be done, and looking for better ways to protect yourself is the only way to help
            prevent these issues in the future. Putting tools in place to help you monitor and keep track of what is happening on your network or computers is a good place to start when it comes to your security, along with login
            trackers and 2FA. Finding a network monitor may be tricky, but they are helpful. For example DarkTrace, an AI learning network monitor, is used to monitor 'normal' and 'abnormal' activity on a large scale network. Having this
            in place, with enough time for it to learn and your confiurations set up as need-be, would allow you to see potential threats on a network or potentially threatening activity towards your network. Although these aren't cheap ,
            it's very much worth it rather than getting attacked and not knowing about it until it's too late. Also, 2Fa, also an expensive but necessary implementation, but extremely helpful with preventing people from running through accounts
            and logins with no type of indication that they are doing so. Although I only listed two examples, it should be clear that when trying to be as secure as possible, you need to cover your bases. Knowing more about how everything
            communicates, is structured, alongside knowing typical activity and usage, goes a long way in knowing how to secure your infrastructure. Also, these tools can help you understand more about your usage and activity, so you can get
            a better glance at what might be considered abnormal in your situation. In the end, a lot of asynchronous planning and action needs to be done in this stage, to make sure everything is getting done correctly, securely, and better than before.
          </p>
          <h3>How To Be Prepared For An Attack</h3>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em;">
            A good place to start researching for the answer to this would be with guidelines or with NIST. To summarize, you need to know what was lost/damaged, replace outdated software/hardware with newer tech,
            find new software that could help you get more familiar with whats happening on your devices, make sure to keep things backed up and back up OFTEN, and then you need to make sure credentials are a top priority for security.
            When looking into newer hardware, we have to determine if our current hardware is outdated, and the answer is probably yes. Servers, operating systems, computers and everything
            else all have a point in time where they need to be upgraded. Though this might not be a result of cyber crime, it does need to be thought of when looking over your infrastructure and spying potential targets for an attack.
            As said before, every scenario is different, but the road to recovery is somewhat cookie cutter, in the way that we need to see what the issue was, and prevent it from happening in the future, by any means necessary. Yes it may be pricey
            but in the end, you're keeping your infomation, along with others infomation safe. The cost of recovery is much higher than the cost to maintain, with regards to both money and stress. It's better to be safe than sorry.

        <h5 style="margin-top: -40px;">The Ethics Behind 'Hacking Back'</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="textBox" id="scroller">
        <div class="textContent">
          <h3>What is 'Hacking Back'?</h3>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em;">Hacking back, also known as revenge hacking, is taking the opportunity to ‘hit’ back a group/individual/etc who has attempted malicious activity towards your organizations/selfs machines or network. Hacking back can be viewed as both ethical and unethical, depending on who you are talking to. But is it actually ethical or unethical? It takes a lot to determine the ethics behind a reverse hacker, like the point of view, what information/hardware was stolen or damaged, and what the initial ‘attack’ was. Some might say hacking back would be illegal, since there isn’t a really a clause for it anywhere, but others might say it’s necessary to prevent future problems or attempts.</p>
          <h3>Is Revenge Hacking Unethical?</h3>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em;">
          Now we can discuss the reasons why revenge hacking might be unethical. Again, as said before, this might be up for argument due to different standpoints. But looking at it from a somewhat legal point of view, some on either side might agree that the ethics might be negative, just because the law says it is. Hacking back is more or less only unethical a the legal standpoint, because as said before that is where the law and people who study the law label it as ‘likely illegal’. Now this does depend on the laws of the country the attacker and the victim are in, universally most laws in this topic are similar, but sometimes not enforced. But these laws werent written with this form of hacking in mind. They were written for people go initiate the connection and hack with no ‘revenge’ as intent. One noticeably bad effect hacking back would be a ‘hacking war’, which would just be the back and forth hacking until one party is destroyed or cannot go further. It might get to the point where it was mutual enough, so legal action wouldn’t be an option.</p>
          <h3>Is Revenge Hacking Ethical?</h3>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em;">The standpoint that I think most of us might agree with, is that this is an ethical thing to do. Not only because that is what we are interested in, but because we understand both points of view; both the attacker and the victim. Hacking back, as said before is done out of revenge. Being hacked or attacked in some form is never a good experience, and if the people who are after you want money or information, it could be even worse. Hacking back might have to be done to get this information or money back in your possession, if they have the skillset to do so. Also, hacking as a form of revenge can show the initial attacker that they shouldn’t do what they’ve done again. Showing the attacker that they will have more than just legal consequences to their actions might be enough to deter the attacker from doing so again. That might be the more important point of the argument. Deterrence is optimal in many day to day things. Nobody wants to be messed with, and posing a real threat makes people look towards other paths, rather than you.</p>
