      <div class="content" id="about">
        <p>Hello, my name is Ben Kennard. I go to Rochester Institute of Technology as a Cyber Security (BS) student. I am currently in my 2nd year, with multiple courses under my belt related to programming and networking such as: System Administration, Programming for Information Security, Network Services, Computer Science (1 & 2) and Reverse Engineering. With taking these classes, my interest in the subject has only grown, and I am finding myself always trying to learn more and more.</p>
        <p>My life consists of only a few things: programming, learning (in/outside of school), and the outdoors. When I'm not writing code for freelancing or for myself, I am outside being active to keep my brain and my body going. Because school takes up so much of my time, due to challenging courses, I am not able to be apart of clubs, but this doesn't impede on my social skills. </p>
        <p>Some things I am interested in are: music, skateboarding, bike riding, programming, some gaming here and there, product flipping for profit. Many of the projects I work on are related to the reselling community, as that is my main source of income when I'm not working or in school. This community is always in need of development, which is an execellent opportunity for me. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content" id="interests">
        <p>As of February 2024, I am fluent in multiple [programming] languages: Python, Java, C, C#, C++, PHP, nodeJS/javascript, mySQL.</p>
        <p>With these languages I have practiced and used them with: Communication, Networking, authentication systems, webscraping, hashing, blockchain, threading, electronJS.</p>
        <p>Some subjects/lanugages I've moderately dug into: Machine Learning, swift (IOS), bash, fire base DB.</p>
        <p>With taking Reverse Engineering as a class, this increased both my interest and my knowledge of 1. how to reverse engineer malicious applications/programs, 2. how to avoid possible application vulnerabilities through app structure and packing.</p>
        <p>Some security related tools I am familiar with: wireshark, nmap, burpsuite, IDA Pro, postman, metasploit, dotPeek, traceroute, apateDNS.</p>
        <p>Using these tools, I have been able to practice my abilities using the website <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/" class="contact">HackTheBox</a>. I have also been able to practice these skills and abilites on real websites, with permission of the owners, to help them with making a more secure website.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>2018-2019: Optimax Systems INC. - Part(optic) manufacturer on the floor, under supervisor Larry Thayer</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>2020-Present: Optimax System INC - Network Security Analyst in IT, under supervisor Kris Harris. Working with DarkTrace, ESET, ManageEngine, CyberHawk to keep the network, computers, machines and information safe from vulnerabilities and attackers.</p>
        <p>My freelance/contract work consists mainly of script writing through the application Discord. Through this, I usually end up writing a script a week for someone (depending on difficulty and length). Also, this has opened the door of becoming in house developers for a couple of reselling related groups: Profit Prophets, and Lightning Notify. Through these groups, I work either by myself or in small teams of developers, to give the group members helpful and unique tools to help them succeed in purchasing limited items.</p>

      <div class="content" id="project">
        <p>PROJECTS:</p>
        <p>Prophets/Bunsen Cookie Generator - A Node.JS application, built in electron, that generates AKAMAI cookies using Bezier curves and Fitts Law alongside browser automation. This application is protected by JS obfuscation and 0auth2.</p>
        <p>Profit Prophets Tools - A python/flask appication, protected by user/key authentication, that provides a number of tools such as: high speed proxy connectivity testing, information scrapers for products on shopify sites, creating accounts on sites using proxies, and more related to web interaction/scraping. (DISCONTINUED BUT UPGRADED)</p>
        <p>Profit Prophets Tools V3: An electron application, protected by key/user authentication through 0auth2, that provides many helpful tools related to purchasing limited items online. This project was used to increase node.js knowledge and help users.</p>
        <p>Bunsen Autoclicker - An electronJS/python application that monitors chat channels in the application Discord. This application is used to join Discord server invites and open links in browser windows using a keyword system. This tied with lightning autofill help each person increase their odds when it comes to purchasing/getting access to limited product releases.</p>
